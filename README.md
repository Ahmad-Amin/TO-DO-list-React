Hello, This is Ahmad Amin.
I had completed another project using JavaScript Library i.e. React.js. This is a simple Todo list application, where you can simply add and remove the items from the list with the beautifull minimalist design.
You can check it out yourself at https://ahmad-amin.github.io/TO-DO-list-React/
